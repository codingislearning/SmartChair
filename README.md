# SmartChair
Microsoft One Week Hackathon 2017

Idea is to detect person posture using 14 pressure sensor data and alert him if he is sitting in bad posture for long.

Dataset has following 4 classes:
   1 for Good Posture
  11 for leaning sideways like torso on side and legs on other
 111 for slouching forward
1111 for forcing backing with hip on the front( movie watching position)
